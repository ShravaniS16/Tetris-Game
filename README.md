# Tetris-Game
This code creates a simple Tetris game using Pygame. Players control falling tetromino shapes on a 10x10 grid, moving, rotating, or dropping them to clear full rows. It features collision detection, row clearing, and game-over logic when blocks can't fit. Basic controls make for a functional Tetris experience.
